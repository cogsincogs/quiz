set up button event listener or something - just so something happens when you press the button

add a 'confirm answer' button so that selecting an answer doesn't commit you straight away

when answer has been confirmed, colour the buttons red and green to show right and wrong answers, add a marker to show which option the player selected, and change confirm answer button to a 'next question' button which just refreshes the page

-------------------------------------------------------------

after all the functional stuff is done:

fix centering of list if possible - currently just 45% aligned horizontally - not responsive to length of answers

make buttons look less 1990

create a few different colour schemes to make it  more interesting - not just random colours for everything, that would look awful


--------------------------------------------------------------

only after all that stuff, if there's still time, do this

add some settings to change the api properties (e.g. change category or difficulty)
